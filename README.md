# Bank Risk Controller System 
# Project Overview
 The Bank Risk Controller System is a machine learning-based application designed to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. This system helps banks and financial institutions assess the risk associated with lending money to clients, enabling informed decision-making and improved risk management.

The application uses a Decision Tree Classifier trained on a comprehensive dataset, evaluating customers based on various input features such as income, credit amount, employment history, and more. The prediction outcomes assist banks in categorizing customers as either high or low risk, thereby optimizing loan approval processes.

# Features
User-Friendly Interface: A web-based interface built using Streamlit for easy data input and visualization.
Accurate Risk Prediction: The system uses a Decision Tree model to predict whether a customer will default.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the dataset through various graphs and plots.
Model Evaluation: Provides a detailed classification report, including precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
Scalable Deployment: Ready for deployment on platforms like Render or Heroku.
Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language used for model building and backend.
Streamlit: Framework for developing the web-based interface.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization.
Pickle: For saving and loading the machine learning model and scaler.

# Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the sentiment of restaurant reviews. The sentiment analysis model is trained on a dataset of restaurant reviews and can classify the sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

# Project Structure
app.py: The main file for the Streamlit application.
sentiment_model.pkl: The trained Logistic Regression model for sentiment analysis.
tfidf_vectorizer.pkl: The TF-IDF vectorizer used to transform text data into numerical form.
Restaurant reviews.csv: The dataset used for training the model (not included in this repository).
README.md: This file.
# Features
Text Input: Users can input a restaurant review into the application.
Sentiment Prediction: The application predicts the sentiment of the entered review as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
Sample Data Display: Optionally, users can view a sample of the dataset used to train the model.
# Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-review-sentiment-analysis.git
cd restaurant-review-sentiment-analysis
Install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit application:

streamlit run app.py
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains restaurant reviews, ratings, and other metadata. The sentiment labels were created based on the ratings:

Ratings 4-5: Positive
Rating 3: Neutral
Ratings 1-2: Negative
# Model
The sentiment analysis model is a Logistic Regression classifier trained on TF-IDF vectorized text data. The model was trained using the Scikit-learn library.

# How to Use
Run the Streamlit application using the command:

streamlit run app.py
Enter a restaurant review in the provided text area.

Click on "Predict Sentiment" to see the predicted sentiment.

Optionally, check the "Show Sample Data" box to view the first few rows of the dataset.

# Deployment
You can deploy this application to any cloud platform that supports Python and Streamlit, such as Render, Heroku, or Streamlit Sharing.
